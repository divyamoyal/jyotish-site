						<b>Astrology....</b><br />
						It was in the year 1996 October, on the day of Vijaya dashami (Dasara) (a very big festival for all the Hindus) Day I was sitting near by a Temple and all of a sudden I got a thought "How about learning Astrology???". Till that time I had no knowledge in astrology at all. But as a traditional family we used to see some astrological debates between my uncles.<br />
						Immediately after getting the thought of learning astrology I went to my uncle's (Late. Sri Gollapelli Pedda Hanmandlu, a well known traditional astrologer from Dhamapuri) house and asked him to teach me Astrology. He kindly accepted my request. It is a Swayam Siddha Muhurta day, when I started learning Astrology.  It's been a tough challenge for me as I don't know even the basic things like number and names of Nakshtras and rashis. In the mean time I completed my P.G. exams and continued learning astrology.  I wanted to do a Ph.D. in Telugu but, the Almighty's wish was different and I obeyed it.<br />
						By birth I am a Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis patient. With the effect of the disease suddenly I lost sensation of my both legs while I was going to write an entrance exam for Ph.D. This incident has changed whole my life. I had to take bed rest for a year. After recovering a little bit I again started learning Astrology. I studied traditional astrology for 3 years. As my uncle was a traditional astrologer he did not teach the other systems of astrology. By studying the books of Sri Sivala Subrahmanyam and other writers I came to know that K.P. Astrology is more accurate than other systems in astrology. So I studied K.P. System too. I also referred Lalkitab and some other systems in Vedic Astrology. With the knowledge I gained from my gurus and books I practiced it day and night for more than 3 years. Then only I started giving Astrology services to people.<br />
